This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

   Ruby version : 2.5.1
   Ruby on Rails : 5.2.1

AIM of the APP

This is the database side to our rails application The hacking news, which aims to be a dashboard where users can create and comment articles. 

They can also comment comments!

To run the app you just have to do the Bundle install to install the gems from the Gemfile.
